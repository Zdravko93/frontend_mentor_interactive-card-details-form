## 🧠 My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 - For clean, accessible markup
- CSS Custom Properties - For consistent, reusable styling
- Flexbox - For a flexible and responsive layout
- Mobile-First Workflow - to ensure optimal design across all devices
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) - for real-time form updates and validation 

### ✨ Features
- Real-time updates on the card preview as the user types
- Inline validation with error messages for incorrect input formats
- Fully responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessible focus and hover states for better UX
- Modular, readable code structure for scalability

### What I learned

- Deepened my understanding of RegEx for form validation, especially for validating card numbers, expiry dates, and CVC inputs
- Improved my JavaScript skills, particularly in handling real-time DOM updates and input validation
- Reinforced CSS knowledge — especially around Flexbox layouts, responsive design, and form styling
- Developed a keener eye for UX details, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across devices

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go-to reference for JavaScript and CSS syntax
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A valuable resource during the form validation process. I learned a great deal about RegEx and its applications in form validation.
- [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - A great tool to test and debug regular expressions interactively

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add subtle animations or transitions when the card details update
- Integrate basic unit tests for form validation logic
- Experiment with CSS Grid for layout variation and more complex responsiveness.
